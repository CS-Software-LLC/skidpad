# @skidpad/rapier

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 023714b: Milestone 2: four wheels, suspension, Rapier host.

  - physics: the default vehicle model is now `simulation.model = "fourWheel"`: four wheels on independent raycast suspension (spring, bump and rebound damping, anti-roll bar, bump stop) over a six-degree-of-freedom chassis proxy with roll and pitch inertia, Ackermann steering and per-wheel camber. The planar single-track model stays as `"singleTrack"`. Golden validation results, the scripted-drive hashes and the determinism scenario hashes change.
  - physics: low-speed handling (ADR-0005) gains a damping term on the wheel-tire mode and a rolling-resistance moment that is smooth through zero, so a nudged parked car no longer rings. New tire parameter `lowSpeedDamping` (damping ratio, default 0.3).
  - Definitions gain `chassis.rollInertia`, `chassis.pitchInertia`, `axles[].suspension`, `steering.ackermann` and `simulation.model`, all with defaults; the format version stays 1.
  - Telemetry gains body pose channels (`PosZ`, `Roll`, `Pitch`, rates, `Quat*`) and per-wheel channels (`_FL`, `_FR`, `_RL`, `_RR`) for load, slips, forces, camber, suspension travel, rate and force, steer, contact, lock and spin angle. The `_F`/`_R` channels are now axle sums (forces) and means (speeds, slips).
  - External host contract (ADR-0002, ADR-0009): `World.setHostMode`, `writeHostBody`, `writeWheelContact`, `clearWheelContact`, `readHostImpulse`, `wheelRays`, `wheelPositionsView`. WASM ABI version 2.
  - New package `@skidpad/rapier` with `RapierVehicle` and `createChassisBody`, driving a Rapier 3D rigid body in a y-up or z-up scene, including moving platforms.
  - Presets carry suspension rates, roll and pitch inertia.
