Milestone 4: the drivetrain (ADR-0011).

- physics: the interim `drive` torque law is replaced by a drivetrain solved each substep as one constrained rotational system in the wheel speeds plus the engine speed: a power unit (`direct`, `combustion` with a torque curve, engine braking, idle governor and rev limiter, or `electric` with constant torque then constant power and lift-off regeneration), a clutch with an automatic law, a gearbox with reverse and a final drive, open, locked and clutch-pack limited-slip differentials, and a centre differential for all-wheel drive. Shafts have no speed state; their inertias are reflected onto the wheels and the clutch, differential locks and brakes are bounded constraints solved jointly, so the exact brake lock of milestone 3 is kept and a locked clutch or spool is stable at every substep rate. Every preset gets a drivetrain (hatchback: five-speed automatic on an open front differential; sports car: six-speed with a clutch-pack LSD; kart: single speed with a centrifugal-style clutch and a solid rear axle), so 0–100 km/h now includes the launch and the shifts. Golden results, scripted-drive hashes and the recorded laps change.
- Definitions: `drive` is gone; `drivetrain: { powerUnit, transmission, front, rear, center }` takes its place with defaults (a `direct` power unit). `migrateDefinition()` and `World.addVehicle()` convert a legacy `drive` block; the format version stays 1.
- Inputs gain `clutch` (0 engaged … 1 open) and `gear` (negative reverse, 0 neutral or drive, positive gear). Input stride 6, WASM ABI version 3. `@skidpad/input` maps Q / E (or the Shift keys) to one gear per press and C to the clutch.
- Telemetry gains `EngineRpm`, `EngineTorque`, `Gear`, `ClutchSlip`, `ClutchTorque`, `DiffLockTorque_F`, `DiffLockTorque_R`, `CenterLockTorque` and `Clutch`; `DriveTorque_*` is now the half-shaft torque per wheel. Snapshot format version 2 adds the drivetrain state.
- The understeer scenario reduces each point by the Ackermann angle of the path actually driven (ISO 4138) and holds speed with a PI controller, so part-throttle speed errors no longer bias the gradient; the single-track gradients move within a few hundredths of a degree per g of the previous values.
- The sandbox HUD shows the engine's rpm and gear from telemetry and the engine note follows them; the benchmark baseline is refreshed for the added solve (about 0.5 µs per vehicle-substep on the four-wheel model).
